# Welcome to Blokus
The goal of the game is to place all of your pieces on the board, while trying to prevent your opponents from placing their pieces. Each piece is composed of tiles, and when you place a piece, you earn 1 point for every tile in a piece. Pieces can only be placed adjacent to pieces of the same color. The player (green) first goes, followed by the 3 opponents. The game ends when everyone is out of moves.

## Controls 
- Left Click: places the piece if the move is valid. 
- Right Click: rotates the selected piece clockwise, one quarter.
- Middle Click: flips the selected piece.
- Left and Right Arrow Keys: select a different piece.

## Setup
Clone the repo, and run gui.py. Click start in the welcome screen to start the game.
